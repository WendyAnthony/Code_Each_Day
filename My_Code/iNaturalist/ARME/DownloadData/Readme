Another Shiny app version using rinat to download current ARME iNaturalist data (max 10,000 records) to display interactively on a leaflet map

The app displays different tabs for north and south data, ARME project data, observations needing ID, and casual observations (missing some critical info, or just wrong)

A Download button will prompt to download a dated .csv file to local computer

This app Runs fine locally in RStudio, however ...

Download button doesn't seem to want to display when published in Shiny server, so I must be missing something? ... 

And as this app downloads 10,000 maximum records, due to size / time-out, even without the Download button, it won't run on a Shiny server
