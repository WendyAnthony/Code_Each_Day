Research-grade iNaturalist ARME observations in an interactive leaflet map Shiny app

To get the Shiny app to work on your local computer in RStudio:

* Download app.R
* Open in RStudio

* I'm sorry to say that this app doesn't seem to always play nice with the 'Run App' button ... so ...

* Go through each code line to install libraries and download data separately
i.e. place cursor at beginning of line library("Shiny") and press keys Command+Enter (Mac) - probably Control+Enter(Win)

* at beginning of Shiny App section, highlight this whole section and press keys Command+Enter (Mac) - probably Control+Enter(Win)

>>> the Shiny app should open in a separate popup window

>>> to open Shiny app in browser, click button "Open in Browser"
