Geog 103,Introduction to Physical Geography,"Introduces Physical Geography using an earth-systems approach. Topics include atmospheric, ecologic, and geomorphic systems driving the creation of weather and climate, landforms, biomes and ecosystems. The interrelationship between these systems as well as the role of human agency will be discussed.",,,Base,,
Geog 101A,"Environment, Society & Sustainability","Introduction to the functioning of the biosphere, the ways in which humans alter natural processes, environmental consequences of these alterations and the implications for sustainability. Topics include: energy flows, biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem structure and dynamics, pollution, global change, water resources, biodiversity, endangered species, protected areas, agriculture and food, forestry, marine resources, poverty and development and different worldviews. Potential for a sustainable society is discussed.",,,Base,,
Geog 276,Introduction to Geomorphology,"Introduction to Earth surface process and landforms including riverine, desert, coastal, glacial, hillslope and permafrost environments. Focus on regional and Canadianlandscapes. Involves a field trip.",,,Earth Systems,,
Geog 274,Introduction to Biogeography,"Examines the relationships among organisms - principally plants and animals - and their environment, emphasizing their distributions across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Examines basic ecological and evolutionary concepts affecting biogeographic processes of dispersal, speciation and extinction; how patterns of biodiversity change over space and time from early earth history to the contemporary environment; the nature of changing biotic distributions with increasing human impacts and global change.",Biology 12 or BIOL 150B recommended.,101A or 103.,Earth Systems,,
Geog 272,Introduction to Climatology and Hydrology,An investigation of the fundamental processes controlling climate and hydrology. Explores various factors and interactions that determine the spatial and temporal variations of individual climate elements. Special attention is given to the mutual interaction of climate with the Earth's surface and the role that ground surface type or cover plays in moderating local climate and hydrology.,,,Earth Systems,,
Geog 376,Process Geomorphology,"An investigation of the physical processes that create and maintain landforms. Focus on measurement and analysis of morphodynamic processes in fluvial, aeolian, coastal, glacial, hillslope, and/or periglacial landscapes (e.g., sediment transport, erosion, wind/wave energy, river discharge, glacial dynamics, weathering rates). Involves a field trip and/or a group project.",,,Earth Systems,,
Geog 370,Hydrology,"An overview of hydrological processes, measurement techniques and data analysis. The movement of water in the hydrologic cycle via precipitation, interception, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, infiltration, soil moisture, groundwater flow and streamflow generation are examined. Applied aspects and local examples will be discussed. Involves laboratory assignments and a field trip.",1.5 units of 100-level MATH recommended.,,Earth Systems,,
Geog 373,Applied Climatology,A study of the application of physical principles to practical problems in climatology and the reciprocal interaction between climate and human activities. Topics include: urban effects on climate; air pollution; human bioclimatology; agricultural climatology; and methods of microclimatic modification.,,,Earth Systems,,
Geog 358,Landscape Ecology,"Landscape ecology emphasizes the interaction between spatial pattern and ecological processes. Focuses on the role of spatial heterogeneity across a range of scales. Focus is on the role of spatial heterogeneity in affecting the distribution and abundance of organisms, mass and energy transfers, and alterations of this structure by natural or anthropogenic forces. Implications for resource management and conservation are discussed.",274 recommended.,"One of 272, 274, 276.",Earth Systems,,
Geog 424,Field Studies in Coastal Geomorphology,"An advanced, field-based exploration of coastal geomorphic processes and landforms. Involves a weeklong field trip to local coastal sites where students apply geomorphic concepts and methods towards a series of independent research assignments and/or group projects. Areas of investigation will span nearshore to backshore environments and wave, tidal, fluvial/estuarine, and aeolian processes. A field trip fee may be applied.",,,Earth Systems,,
Geog 474,Field Studies in Biogeography,"A field-research course in biogeography based on a combination of reading, discussion, and data analysis. Involves a week-long field trip; a field trip fee may be applied.",,,Earth Systems,,
Geog 476,Advanced Studies in Geomorphology,"Focusing on various geomorphologic themes, students will complete a major research project based on field work to supplement lectures, seminars and field/lab projects.","Credit will be granted for only one of 476, 471C.",,Earth Systems,,
Geog 477,Field Studies in Physical Geography,"The nature of scientific research in physical geography is examined through field and laboratory techniques. Includes a week-long field camp where basic approaches, methodologies and techniques are used to prepare a series of reports based on field data and collected samples. A field trip fee may be applied.","Credit will be granted for only one of 477, 471D.","One of 274, 358, 370, 373, 376; permission of the department by 15 March of previous Winter Session.",Earth Systems,,
