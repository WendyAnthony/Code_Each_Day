<div id="About" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>About This App</h2>
  <div>
  	An experimental <a href='https://wendyanthony.shinyapps.io/GeogInteract-app/' target="_blank">Shiny Code Sandbox</a> was created to develop an online, interactive interface to facilitate Geography Course Student Planning. 
  	<br /> This Shiny Clone Website is meant to mimic the Shiny App on the web, without relying on a Shiny Server.
  	<br />

		<h3>Goals:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>to make a web page javascript version of the Geog Course Datatable as in <a href="https://wendyanthony.shinyapps.io/GeogInteract-app/" target="_blank">Shiny App</a></li>
				<li>Make the table interactive, sortable filterable, saveable</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Workflow:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>HTML Table Code: </strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Opened Shiny App Datatable, changing to Show: 100 which will open whole table</li>
						<li>In Chrome Browser Develoment Tools >> Elements >> Find `table` element </li>
							<ul>
								<li>Hover over code to see table in webpage highlighted >> </li>
								<li>Right-click `Table` Element in Elements list >> `Edit as HTML` >> </li>
								<li>Right-click inside `Table` Element >> Select all >> Copy >> Paste into html file</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Tried originally using `CsvToTable.js`, but it got confused with commas</li>						
					</ul>
				</li>
					</ul>

        <h3>The Code</h3>
          <div>
            <a href='https://github.com/WendyAnthony/Code_Each_Day/blob/master/My_Code/GeogInteractive/app.R' target='_blank'>Shiny App Code on GitHub</a>
              <br /><br />
            Filtered table code adapted from Stackoverflow <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53499066/downloadhandler-with-filtered-data-in-shiny' target='_blank'>Downloadhandler with filtered data in Shiny</a>
          </div>


<!-- 
		<h3>Workflow to use CsvToTable.js:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Data Cleaning: </strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I used <a href="https://www.cssscript.com/lightweight-csv-table-converter-csvtotable-js/#google_vignette" target="_blank">CsvToTable.js</a> to convert the `Geog-Course-flowcharts.csv` Geog course datatable file used in the Shiny App</li>	
						<li>The csv file is full of `"` which are showing up <a href="https://people.geog.uvic.ca/wanthony/website/geog-curriculum-maps/test/csv-to-table-preclean.html" target="_blank">Preclean</a> </li>
						<li>Open csv file in excel replacing all `,` and all double-spaces with a single space</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Once the cleaned file was uploaded (must be online for this to work), opening the file autmatically create a table in the HTML file <a href="https://people.geog.uvic.ca/wanthony/website/geog-curriculum-maps/test/csv-to-table.html" target="_blank">After Cleaning</a></li>
				<li>In Chrome Browser Develoment Tools, I found < table></ table> element following the < script> element</li>
				<li>Right-click < table> element >> edit as HTML >> copy contents of edit box >> paste into HTML file, just before `scripts` >> result as found below >>></li>
					</ul>
