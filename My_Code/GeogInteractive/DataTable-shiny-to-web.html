		<h3>Goals:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>to make a web page javascript version of the Geog Course Datatable as in <a href="https://wendyanthony.shinyapps.io/GeogInteract-app/" target="_blank">Shiny App</a></li>
				<li>Make the table interactive, sortable filterable, saveable</li>
			</ul>

		 is to make a web page javascript version of the interactive, filterable, saveable Datatable as in <a href="https://wendyanthony.shinyapps.io/GeogInteract-app/" target="_blank">Shiny App</a>
	</div>

					<h3>Workflow:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Data Cleaning: </strong>
								<ul>
									<li>I used <a href="https://www.cssscript.com/lightweight-csv-table-converter-csvtotable-js/#google_vignette" target="_blank">CsvToTable.js</a>, to convert the `Geog-Course-flowcharts.csv` Geog course datatable file used in the Shiny App</li>	
									<li>The csv file is full of `"` which are showing up <a href="https://people.geog.uvic.ca/wanthony/website/geog-curriculum-maps/test/csv-to-table-preclean.html" target="_blank">Preclean</a> </li>
									<li>Open csv file in excel replacing all `,` and all double-spaces with a single space</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Once the cleaned file was uploaded (must be online for this to work), opening the file autmatically create a table in the HTML file <a href="https://people.geog.uvic.ca/wanthony/website/geog-curriculum-maps/test/csv-to-table.html" target="_blank">After Cleaning</a></li>
							<li>In Chrome Browser Develoment Tools, I found < table></ table> element following the < script> element</li>
							<li>Right-click < table> element >> edit as HTML >> copy contents of edit box >> paste into HTML file, just before `scripts` >> result as found below >>></li>
