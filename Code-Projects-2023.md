**Today's Progress**: 
- Repurposed `Shiny app` I created in 2021-08, making reactive 2022-12 to create searchable data table for sample of Geography Course info
		- uploaded app.R and .csv data file to github
- Deployed app on Shiny server after adding html concept map dataviz, download csv (doesn't save filtered datatable)

**Thoughts:** 
- Glad to have a sandbox from which to experiment with adding different interactive visualizations
- Pleasantly surprised to get so much function done
