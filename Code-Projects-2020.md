# Week IV <a name="weekIV"/>

## R1D21 2020-01-21 <a name="R1D21"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- trying some more ```highcharter``` advanced mapping, creating a map by importing geojson files, using code samples from the package maker, with some tweaking; the map shows the continents, country boundaries, plate boundaries, marine currents, volcano locations; with interactive tooltips

**Thoughts:** 
- map wouldn't work, I had to tweak the code, and was successful - I'm pretty proud of myself for figuring out what to do to make the code work! ;)

**Links to code work:** 
- http://jkunst.com/highcharter/highmaps.html
  - tweaked the code to get world map to show: changed to ```data = world``` added ```geojson = TRUE```

## R1D20 2020-01-20 <a name="R1D20"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- trying some more ```highcharter``` functions to make charts with new series of data, bands on the y-axis, grouping together values

**Thoughts:** 
- when there are errors working from someone's demo tutorial, or code doesn't work, don't assume it's me - sometimes the original has code spelling errors, or leaves out repeat info that need to know how to add to without being told

- https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/136836_45410b2aedcf49a5b46567f3fd6015bc.html

## R1D19 2020-01-19 <a name="R1D19"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- trying to get D3 to run with R shiny
- testing ```highcharter``` in ```Shiny```, adding more types & themes, also trying different data

**Thoughts:** 
- very interested in the interactivity of ```D3``` & ```Shiny``` in combination, though having trouble accessing different data
- would like to find a way to add different data choices to ```highcharter``` in ```Shiny```

**Today's Progress**:
- trying to get webscraping html tables to work in R, but had trouble with tables that had columns that spanned over multiple columns

**Thoughts:** 
- make sure I don't create messy tables with multiple spanning columns

## R1D16 2020-01-16 <a name="R1D16"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- found a way to generate animated gifs from environment canada forecasts using Photoshop

**Thoughts:** 
- animating weather forecasts helps to understand change over time

**Make animated gifs with Photoshop (CS5)**  
1. File > Scriptw > Load files into stack > Browse for files > open > OK
2. set loop count (dropdown arrow below first gif)
3. hamburger menu at top right of animation frames window
4. Make frames from layers > select all > set loop count for all selected
5. Play button to view
6. File > Save for Web > Preset: GI  128 Dithered; Colors: 256 > Preview > Save

## R1D15 2020-01-15 <a name="R1D15"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- tried to get cluster code to show more markers when zoomed in

**Thoughts:** 
- cleaning and preparing data takes a lot of work - much more than trying to figure out the code sometimes!

## R1D14 2020-01-14 <a name="R1D14"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- learned to make non-linear presentation in Powerpoint, using sections and linking to each section with images in a TOC

**Thoughts:** 
- in older version of Powerpoint 2016, this doesn't work as simply as newer versions, so I had to figure out what would work with older version

## R1D13 2020-01-13 <a name="R1D13"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- created code to access my iNaturalist observations
- created ```leafet r``` map for my 1243 research-grade iNaturalist observations @ https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/wendy_anthony

**Thoughts:** 
- cleaning and preparing data takes a lot of work - much more than trying to figure out the code sometimes!

## R1D12 2020-01-12 <a name="R1D12"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- reviewing use of ```Linux UNIX commands``` in ```MacOSX Terminal``` with Unix Tutorial (for Synoptic Meteorology course Geog484)
- trying, without success to 'Compile UNIX software packages' ... couldn't get the syntax correct to ```./configure --prefix=$HOME/units174``` to generate / install in correct directory, after trying multiple different ways (I was able to create new directory, just not configure / install to it - not sure how to find the right syntax)
- working on a ```ggplot2``` precipitation visualization, got it working, then did something to mess it up ... now nothing works!!

**Thoughts:** 
- I always thought compiling programs in terminal would be a challenge, and indeed this is - install not working correctly yet??
- I need to save a code file when it is working, and try other stuff on a copy - 'twould save me a lot of heart-ache!!

## R1D11 2020-01-11 <a name="R1D11"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- learn to use ```UNIX commands``` in ```MacOSX Terminal``` with Unix Tutorial (for Synoptic Meteorology course Geog484)
- redid uvic seasonal weather plot in ggplot2 using smaller point size for 'dots' > makes chart easier to read

**Thoughts:** 
- typing commands into terminal is a lot less intimidating than I was expecting
- ```ggplot2``` makes some beautiful charts!

## R1D10 2020-01-10 <a name="R1D10"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- created ggplot2 weather visualization using ```weathercan``` to download 5 years of UVic weather data, and append rows of another year of data using ```rbind``` 
- created facet plots of multiple yearly plot data together
- created new column for meteorological seasons to create a 5 year temp plot coloured by seasons
- had to spend some time to figure out how to reorder the items on the legend (from alphabetic)
- saved plots to ```.png``` files

**Thoughts:** 
- wanted to do some more weather visualizations using ggplot2, over multiple years, and create facets

## R1D8 2020-01-08 <a name="R1D8"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- **Victoria Census shiny app**: Changed column names; added data dictionary to map column names from original data; added raw data table
- **Vancouver Census shiny app**: copy/paste change Victoria to Vancouver
- put both Vancouver & Victoria Census app in an iframe
- created screenshots of 2018 monthly max temperature using GEE NASA/ORNL/DAYMET_V3 dataset
  - created animation using [R code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51310892/import-png-files-and-convert-to-animation-mp4-in-r)
  - created animation using [photoshop](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-make-gif/)

**Thoughts:** 
- would like to figure out how to put both Victoria & Vancouver Census apps in one shiny app, with options to choose one or the other

## R1D7 2020-01-07 <a name="R1D7"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- Playing around in **Google Earth Engine GEE**, with scripts for Canadian Datasets: NRC_CDEM, NASA/ORNL/DAYMET_V3 (learned to change date range, map centre & zoom)

**Thoughts:**

## R1D6 2020-01-06 <a name="R1D6"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- learning to organize my **forked github repositories** by making new 'organizations' and 'transfering ownership' from my main repository (200+ forked repositories) to new forked-organizations

**Thoughts:** 
- too bad github didn't build-in some way to simplify organization of repositories, to make them easier to find than a search
  - I had originally set-up a repository for a list of my personal respositories, and 'pinned' to top of repository page
- Transfer forked repository to new organization: 
  - in Repository, click 'Settings'
  - in 'Danger Zone' click 'Transfer'
  - type name of original repository
  - type or copy/paste name of organization to transfer to

## R1D5 2020-01-05 <a name="R1D5"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- experimenting using **highcharts r wrapper** ```highcharter```
- trying to get **iNaturalist** to work in R ```library("rinat")```  
  - finally got my personal iNaturalist observations to show in R !!!

**Thoughts:** 
- though I've used highcharts code for dataviz, the ```highcharter``` 'wrapper' uses different code styles for same charts
- tutorial samples work, but not with projects I'm involved with e.g. bc-parks  
  - bc-parks is an umbrella project with other individual BC Parks Projects
  - ```rinat``` gives an error; I've tried a few suggestions (a common error with rinat) but no luck so far

**Links to code work:** 
- to extract my personal observations  
  - ```get_inat_obs_user("wendy_anthony", maxresults = "3000")```
  - default is 110 results > I actually have 2200 uploaded observations between Aug 2019 & May 2015
- to Extract just research grade observations  
  - ```wa_inat_userstats_research <- wa_inat_userstats[which(wa_inat_userstats$quality_grade == "research" ),] ```

## R1D4 2020-01-04 <a name="R1D4"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued work on **my UVic website**
- Learning more about ```.md``` styling 
  - e.g. Table of Contents, list items
- trying ```eBird auk``` [auk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/auk/vignettes/auk.html) package

**Thoughts:** 
- using examples from packages work fine (e.g ```auk```), but when trying to import real data, not so much ...
