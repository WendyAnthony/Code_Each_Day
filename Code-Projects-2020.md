## R1D260 2020-12-25 <a name="R1D260"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- In Google Earth (GE) added placemarks with title, map intro & bibliography, and saved as .kml file 
- in html file, added style for title overlay, and style to allow scrolling long text in the balloons

**Thoughts:**
- excited to find different ways to use kml and leaflet
- I did spend some time trying to figure out how to create different Leaflet layers for different kml folders >> no luck
- I did try converting kml to geojson, but all the icon info is lost!

## R1D223 2020-08-10 <a name="R1D223"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- working with Leaflet for R to create another interactive webpage map for my iNaturalist observations, using similar mapping code to my shiny app
- used the R packages ```rinat``` (to access iNaturalist data), ```lubridate``` (to manage the dates), ```leaflet```, ```htmlwidgets``` (to export html file)

**Thoughts:**
- Time to up my game with Leaflet for R
- Marker clusters - when too many markers are close together the clusters aren't separating into single markers (e.g. https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)

## R1D134 2020-05-13 <a name="R1D134"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- tried new-to-me package ```tidycovid19```, merging data from 9 different sources, creating familiar charts

**Thoughts:**
- I hadn't done any coding since finishing my Adv Weather Course, exams and assignments, so after a 3 week break I've been itching to play with R ... COVID-19 lockdown time is starting to phase into different stage, and seems like a perfect time to try to make some of the COVID-19 data viz charts I've been seeing on Twitter

## R1D27 2020-02-04 <a name="R1D27"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- ```ImageMagick``` used ```montage``` to create a series of 4 tiles of gifs of weather charts downloaded from Environment Canada
- animating montages with convert

**Thoughts:** 
- trying to find a way to make sense of changing weather patterns by animating upper air charts and surface charts for specific date spans

**Links to code work:**

## R1D26 2020-01-31 <a name="R1D26"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- ```ImageMagick``` used ```convert``` to animate gifs of weather charts downloaded from Environment Canada
- testing different loops (default is 1 time through); open in Chrome to run animation; can also use Powerpoint (use slideshow  > play from current slide)

**Thoughts:** 
- Trying to animate 1700 jpg just hung Terminal for almost an hour (had to use Ctrl+D to quit) - 500 seems about right (500 images takes 7 min; 200 images takes 4 minutes)

## R1D25 2020-01-30 <a name="R1D25"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- trying my hand at Tidy Tuesday's San Francisco's Trees; using ```patchwork``` & ```ggtext``` packages
- learning to use ```GSODR``` to download weather data
- learning to use GEMPAK through VM virtual 
- got help from Prof to see if I'd installed ```ImageMagick``` properly 

**Thoughts:** 
- my image file didn't turn out the same as source, so I played with code a bit
- takes some time to download, but works!!
- GEMPAK - I messed up by trying to copy gem file from download to virtual desktop - should have copied from explorer-finder window
- ```ImageMagick``` can't use ```animate``` as MacOS needs ```QXII```, but ```Homebrew``` won't use options to install

## R1D23 2020-01-28 <a name="R1D23"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- playing around with leaflet maps, then found a code snippet adding WMS Web Map Service tiles,  https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/basemaps.html#wms-tiles, did some further searching and found https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/docs/nexrad_mosaic/, using mosaics of NEXRAD base reflectivity

**Thoughts:** 
- I get quite excited when I can get some code to work, after tweaking for local relevance
- I'm very interested to do more weather visualizations

## R1D22 2020-01-26 <a name="R1D22"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- trying out a variety of R packages ... 
   - found a package ```MapPalettes``` that will ```get_color_from_image("")``` supplying hex colour code for colours found in image 

**Thoughts:** 
- what a cool way to find the colours in an image URL

## R1D21 2020-01-21 <a name="R1D21"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- trying some more ```highcharter``` advanced mapping, creating a map by importing geojson files, using code samples from the package maker, with some tweaking; the map shows the continents, country boundaries, plate boundaries, marine currents, volcano locations; with interactive tooltips

**Thoughts:** 
- map wouldn't work, I had to tweak the code, and was successful - I'm pretty proud of myself for figuring out what to do to make the code work! ;)

**Links to code work:** 
- http://jkunst.com/highcharter/highmaps.html
  - tweaked the code to get world map to show: changed to ```data = world``` added ```geojson = TRUE```

## R1D20 2020-01-20 <a name="R1D20"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- trying some more ```highcharter``` functions to make charts with new series of data, bands on the y-axis, grouping together values

**Thoughts:** 
- when there are errors working from someone's demo tutorial, or code doesn't work, don't assume it's me - sometimes the original has code spelling errors, or leaves out repeat info that need to know how to add to without being told

## R1D16 2020-01-16 <a name="R1D16"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- found a way to generate animated gifs from environment canada forecasts using Photoshop

**Thoughts:** 
- animating weather forecasts helps to understand change over time

**Make animated gifs with Photoshop (CS5)**  
1. File > Scriptw > Load files into stack > Browse for files > open > OK
2. set loop count (dropdown arrow below first gif)
3. hamburger menu at top right of animation frames window
4. Make frames from layers > select all > set loop count for all selected
5. Play button to view
6. File > Save for Web > Preset: GI  128 Dithered; Colors: 256 > Preview > Save

## R1D12 2020-01-12 <a name="R1D12"/>
**Today's Progress**:
- reviewing use of ```Linux UNIX commands``` in ```MacOSX Terminal``` with Unix Tutorial (for Synoptic Meteorology course Geog484)
- trying, without success to 'Compile UNIX software packages' ... couldn't get the syntax correct to ```./configure --prefix=$HOME/units174``` to generate / install in correct directory, after trying multiple different ways (I was able to create new directory, just not configure / install to it - not sure how to find the right syntax)
- working on a ```ggplot2``` precipitation visualization, got it working, then did something to mess it up ... now nothing works!!

**Thoughts:** 
- I always thought compiling programs in terminal would be a challenge, and indeed this is - install not working correctly yet??
- I need to save a code file when it is working, and try other stuff on a copy - 'twould save me a lot of heart-ache!!

## R1D6 2020-01-06 <a name="R1D6"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- learning to organize my **forked github repositories** by making new 'organizations' and 'transfering ownership' from my main repository (200+ forked repositories) to new forked-organizations

**Thoughts:** 
- too bad github didn't build-in some way to simplify organization of repositories, to make them easier to find than a search
  - I had originally set-up a repository for a list of my personal respositories, and 'pinned' to top of repository page
- Transfer forked repository to new organization: 
  - in Repository, click 'Settings'
  - in 'Danger Zone' click 'Transfer'
  - type name of original repository
  - type or copy/paste name of organization to transfer to

- though I've used highcharts code for dataviz, the ```highcharter``` 'wrapper' uses different code styles for same charts
- tutorial samples work, but not with projects I'm involved with e.g. bc-parks  
  - bc-parks is an umbrella project with other individual BC Parks Projects
  - ```rinat``` gives an error; I've tried a few suggestions (a common error with rinat) but no luck so far

**Links to code work:** 
- to extract my personal observations  
  - ```get_inat_obs_user("wendy_anthony", maxresults = "3000")```
  - default is 110 results > I actually have 2200 uploaded observations between Aug 2019 & May 2015
- to Extract just research grade observations  
  - ```wa_inat_userstats_research <- wa_inat_userstats[which(wa_inat_userstats$quality_grade == "research" ),] ```

## R1D4 2020-01-04 <a name="R1D4"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued work on **my UVic website**
- Learning more about ```.md``` styling 
  - e.g. Table of Contents, list items
- trying ```eBird auk``` [auk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/auk/vignettes/auk.html) package

**Thoughts:** 
- using examples from packages work fine (e.g ```auk```), but when trying to import real data, not so much ...
