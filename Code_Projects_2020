# Week II <a name="weekII"/>
***
## R1D6 2020-01-06 <a name="R1D6"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- learning to organize my forked github repositories by making new 'organizations' and 'transfering ownership' from my main repository (200+ forked repositories) to new forked-organizations

**Thoughts:** 
- too bad github didn't build-in some way to simplify organization of repositories, to make them easier to find than a search
  - I had originally set-up a repository for a list of my personal respositories, and 'pinned' to top of repository page
- Transfer forked repository to new organization: 
  - in Repository, click 'Settings'
  - in 'Danger Zone' click 'Transfer'
  - type name of original repository
  - type or copy/paste name of organization to transfer to

## R1D5 2020-01-05 <a name="R1D5"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- experimenting using highcharts r wrapper ```highcharter```
- trying to get iNaturalist to work in R ```library("rinat")```  
  - finally got my personal iNaturalist observations to show in R !!!

**Thoughts:** 
- though I've used highcharts code for dataviz, the ```highcharter``` 'wrapper' uses different code styles for same charts
- tutorial samples work, but not with projects I'm involved with e.g. bc-parks  
  - bc-parks is an umbrella project with other individual BC Parks Projects
  - ```rinat``` gives an error; I've tried a few suggestions (a common error with rinat) but no luck so far

**Links to code work:** 
- to extract my personal observations  
  - ```get_inat_obs_user("wendy_anthony", maxresults = "3000")```
  - default is 110 results > I actually have 2200 uploaded observations between Aug 2019 & May 2015
- to Extract just research grade observations  
  - ```wa_inat_userstats_research <- wa_inat_userstats[which(wa_inat_userstats$quality_grade == "research" ),] ```

## R1D4 2020-01-04 <a name="R1D4"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued work on UVic website
- Learning more about ```.md``` styling 
  - e.g. Table of Contents, list items
- trying ```eBird auk``` [auk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/auk/vignettes/auk.html) package

**Thoughts:** 
- using examples from packages work fine (e.g ```auk```), but when trying to import real data, not so much ...
