**Today's Progress**: 
- Revisited calendar heatmap, learned from Dominic Roye, first done Dec 2020, updated for 2022
- Created functions for repeating code chunks!!

**Thoughts:** 
- Pleased with myself to create functions to reduce duplication of code chunks!!
- Had to restart and clear environment a few times to ensure I wasn't using unexpected objects
- Working over 2 different times today: 1 hour - to create and print small 2023 calendar with ```calendR```, and 3 1/2 hours to recreate heat map calendars, and write functions to serve 4 different use-cases using different palettes ... though writing the functions seems to have taken a long time, I'm still learning how to create functions, and pleased at my persistence
- when re-writing code / retrying functions, I added new numbers to my final charts, going by 10s for each different code change (thus final images are numbered 44 - 4 runs, 4th try)

**Today's Progress**: 
- Got back to Shiny app for my Phenology photo data
- Finally got the Ouput table and map to be reactive to selectInput

**Thoughts:** 
- Took lots of trial and error, persistence, and testing Reactivity as recently learned in Shiny workshops
- Persistence pays off!
- Working on data and purposes meaningful to me makes the difficulties of exploring new code easier to bear
- When choosing location that species photo doesn't exist, error message appears instead of map, but continuing to choose locations to find one makes map appear

**Today's Progress**: 
- added code to duplicate, then change file name of image exif data csv created by ```z-2-Photo-Map-Folder.Rmd``` file created to map all photos in a folder 

**Thoughts:** 
- Maybe create a ```.Rmd``` file for the leaflet timeslider ```.R```, including the html code, that when knit would also create the html leaflet map widget

## r3d221 2022-08-09 <a name="r3d221"/></a>
**Today's Progress**: 
- tried different ways to make a time slider with leaflet map in html, while including popup with photos, using js
- read csv file; make date/time column a date value using ```lubridate```; omit na values; use ```geojsonio::geojson_json()``` to create and save json file  from csv using ```geojsonio::geojson_write()```
- time column must be NON-capitalized to ensure date is included below time slider

**Thoughts:** 
- I wanted to see if I could add a time-slider to leaflet map of vacation photos

## r3d157 2022-06-07 <a name="r3d158"/></a>
**Today's Progress**: 
1. I created a package ```natmapr``` using the functions I created to make ggplots out of iNaturalist observations
2. I created another function to include with ```natmapr``` package, to create a leaflet map from iNaturalist observations
- I couldn't seem to save the html file in the same function, so I created another function to save the leaflet map at html file. In order to use it the leaflet function needs to be ```m <- inat_leaflet()```, so the m object can be used by ```inat_leaflet_save()```
- Moving from Things-to-do list, "Now, I'd like to create some more functions for the ```natmapr``` package to use the code function I figured out yesterday to use leaflet to plot maps of iNaturalist data, with data in marker popups"

**Thoughts:** 
1. I was having problems getting function in package to work, as ```devtools::check``` made me follow proper conventions for my code (and that's a GOOD thing!)
- I uploaded sample data ```.RDS``` file, and then had to use df$col formatting to access the column names properly
2. I need to figure out a way NOT to use ```%>%``` function in package function as there is "no visible global function definition for ‘%>%’". I tried ```magrittr::%>%``` but it didn't work
- had to use old way of using leaflet code using separate lines refering to the updated m object e.g.  m <- leaflet::leaflet(data)  m <- leaflet::addTiles(m).  m <- leaflet::addCircleMarkers(m, fillOpacity = 0.5, radius = 0.8, color = "red", ~long, ~lat)

**Links to code work:** 
1. ```natmapr``` package files: https://github.com/WendyAnthony/Code_Each_Day/tree/master/My_Code/PackageFunctions/natmapr

2. ```natmapr``` package files: https://github.com/WendyAnthony/Code_Each_Day/tree/master/My_Code/PackageFunctions/natmapr 
- Leaflet map as a webpage: https://raw.githack.com/WendyAnthony/Code_Each_Day/master/My_Code/PackageFunctions/natmapr/esq_lag.html

**Things-To-Do:**
- try to create more functions!! ;)

## r3d157 2022-06-06 <a name="r3d157"/></a>
**Today's Progress**: 
1. ```iNaturalist``` and ```ggplot2```
- I figured out how to vizualize my iNaturalist observations using ```esquisse``` https://github.com/dreamRs/esquisse ```esquisse::esquisser()```
- I chose to plot scientific name against date
- Had to change date format in ```lubridate```
- found unique values of place names so only one name will exist for the same place
- Subset data for each place
- had to remove extra text pattern from place names to make axis label more readable e.g. BC, etc
- played with changing the ggplot theme one bit-at-a-time
- saved images of plots, and csv files for each subset gitplace


2. ```iNaturalist``` and ```leaflet```
- Then, I figured out how to make a function to create leaflet map marker popups!!!

**Thoughts:** 
- I'm thrilled to try out making a ```function``` again, to create many ggplots, by substituting place name for data and plot title, as well as filename for saving

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I was reminded that uploading a geojson file to github will automatically produce a mapbox map in the github window when the file is clicked
  - https://github.blog/2013-06-13-there-s-a-map-for-that/
  - I can also embed the geojson file map in a webpage
    - https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files#embedding-your-map-elsewhere
2. I learned to make a webpage for a github repro

  - https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site

**Thoughts:** 
- I'd like to learn more about using github's functionality
- has to be in a high level repository, no sub folders

- BC Land Cover data >> still trying to reduce data set size
  - QGIS couldn't get to clip square AOI region to only Vancouver Island
  - ```raster``` package clip worked GREAT!!
  - Leaflet map loaded much quicker with smaller dataset files to work with

**Thoughts:** 
- Takes lots of time to figure out, search error messages, try something different >>> until it just WORKS!

**Today's Progress**: 
- BC Land Cover data >> still trying to reduce data set size
- Takes too long to read very large, province wide shp files, and reduce data
  - Used QGIS to select features contained in AOI, but result is a square extent, including much of mainland coast 

**Thoughts:** 
- trial and error + patience + lots of time
- computer needs more RAM ... R really slogs things down
  - need to close Chrome tabs, Zotero, most Finder windows, to use less computer processing power ...

- copied json file text to html file
- start work on using ```raster``` to learn to do some remote sensing viz

**Thoughts:** 
- I haven't done a leaflet html map for awhile
- I also haven't worked with javascript much since playing around with leaflet in r ...
- I had to take some time to get the json format right

## r3d97 2022-04-08 <a name="r3d97"/></a>
**Today's Progress**: 
- text analysis in ```r```
  - created a wordcloud as I finished my final paper on BC Climate Change Mitigation Strategies

**Thoughts:** 
- wordcloud helped me to visualize the main themes
- creating a separate word cloud for a decrease in minimum word frequency showed progression of thought through word use

## r3d93 2022-04-04 <a name="r3d93"/></a>
**Today's Progress**: 
- created a leaflet for ```r``` map using ```GPX``` track and ```.csv``` waypoint data from Garmin GPS
- tried different markers

**Thoughts:** 
- I haven't done a leaflet map in ```r``` for awhile
- thought of other tools to add to map: inset map; drawing tools

## r3d86 2022-03-27 <a name="r3d86"/></a>
**Today's Progress**: 
- tried out creating maps from image folder at scale
  - downloaded 8000+ images from camera to one folder on different computer
  - the code worked!!!


**Thoughts:** 
- took longer to download images from camera than to run coade
- getting the photo meta-data into `.csv` form took the longest of process

## r3d85 2022-03-26 <a name="r3d85"/></a>
**Today's Progress**: 
- refined code for creating maps from images in folder
- refined code to rename files in image folder with exif info, and folder name

**Thoughts:** 
- more trial and error
- gotta be careful when making little shifts that might not work, but copying code before testing
- r scripts must be located in folder of images for them to work properly
- copying images from same location into location folder so I can map all images for a location over time
- I'd like to figure out some `r leaflet` code to map images over time
- once images are on map, I'd like to find leaflet code that I can draw boundary around markers and export data (e.g.to see what plants are all in one place - to help with naming, etc)

## r3d83 2022-03-25 <a name="r3d84"/></a>
**Today's Progress**: 
- create code to create `.csv` and 'leaflet map` from folder of images
- learned how to rename files in image folder with exif info, and folder name
- CV: testing how to make ```.pdf``` files from ```rmarkdown```
  - kept trying to change the font from Times New Roman >> couldn't (I don't like the serif of TNR) 

**Thoughts:** 
- lots of trial and error
- r scripts must be located in folder of images for them to work properly
- I'd like to play around more with ```rmarkdown``` pdf formating ```knitr``` and ```latex```

**Today's Progress**: 
- making functions for some of COVID-Canada.Rmd code chunks
  - interactive tooltips
  - for creating data object excluding 'notprov'
  - create data object, choosing Date and 2 different columns !!

**Thoughts:** 
- very proud of myself as this is the first time I've tried to create a function in R - and it worked!!

**Links to code work:**

**Today's Progress**: 
- interactive ggplot graphs in R with ```ggiraph```
- Created interactive linked map / chart for Canada COVID vaccination status
- multiple charts linked together for different vaccination status, early & late dates
- created columns for % vaccinated, and found way to make new column in % format vs decimal

**Thoughts:** 
- I had to find Canada map, to replace US map in code
