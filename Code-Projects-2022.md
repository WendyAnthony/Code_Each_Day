**Today's Progress**: 
- Created interactive linked map / chart for Canada COVID vaccination status
- multiple charts linked together for different status dates
- created columns for % vaccinated, and found way to make new column in % format vs decimal

**Thoughts:** 
- I had to find Canada map, to replace US map in code

- [Interactive COVID-Canada Vaccine web Widget](https://raw.githack.com/WendyAnthony/Code_Each_Day/master/My_Code/COVID-19/output/my_widget_page-multi.html)
- used Canada map https://github.com/kjhealy/canmap  
- inspired by https://www.infoworld.com/article/3626911/easy-interactive-ggplot-graphs-in-r-with-ggiraph.html

**Today's Progress**: 
- Revisited Climate Warming Stripes code and updated to 2021
  - added code for anomaly temp based on 1971-2000 Climate normals

**Thoughts:** 
- had to redo a few things as I was using different data
- takes time, but google searches found what I needed

## R3D3 2022-01-03 <a name="R3D3"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- Created chart of my thyroid RX daily consumption, from csv exported from .xls file using `ggplot2`
- using point, line, and smooth (central line of mean and shaded error)
- combined plots for Imitrex (points) &amp; Thyroid (line) - was able to use one axis
  - couldn't also add the smooth line with error ???
- couldn't seem to get 2nd y-axis to work

**Thoughts:** 
- couldn't seem to get 2nd y-axis to work >>> tried lots of different things
