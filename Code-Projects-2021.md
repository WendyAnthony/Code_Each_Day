## R2D4 2021-01-04 <a name="R2D4"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- tried to get code working for my ```R Shiny``` app of Victoria Census ...
- Just for fun tried making Voronoi tesselations in R, and creating mandalas in random palettes and ```ggplot2```

**Thoughts:** 
- though my ```R Shiny``` app online works, I couldn't get the code to work in R Studio - not sure why, but very early in am, and not quite making sense of finding the problem
- doing something simply for the beauty in it, without actually understanding the math behind it ...

## R2D3 2021-01-03 <a name="R2D3"/>
**Today's Progress**: 
- revisiting ```R Shiny``` apps formatting, including using a ```global.R``` file for the data prep ...
  - refound my ```R Shiny``` Wordcloud app code, I added Trump-only text, needing to up the word count to 7000!

**Thoughts:** 
- after hearing fragments of Trump's 1-hour recorded rant/request of 'finding' GA votes, I decided to find a transcript to analyze using an ```R``` Wordcloud
